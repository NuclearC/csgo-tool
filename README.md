# Some Random CS:GO Crap
So I made this when I was really bored. I have no plans on what this is going to become, although I'm pretty sure it will be some sort of hack/injective DLL for CS:GO. 

## Current Features
 Decent framework for working with configuration.

## Getting Help

### How to compile
Requirements:
 * CMake (latest version pls)
 * Some decent C++14 compiler
 * https://github.com/nlohmann/json
 * https://github.com/tplgy/cppcodec
I am pretty sure I will be adding more dependencies soon, so you might have to frequently check this page before compiling the code.

### How to use
 * Launch CS:GO with `-insecure` command-line flag
 * Inject the compiled shared library to the CS:GO process using any shitty DLL injector
 * Suffer

### Making an Issue
 Don't do it, I will not read any of your autistic crap anyways.

### Contributing 
If you want to add some more autistic crap to this, you better fork the repo and work on your own version. Then you can create a pull request and final decision will be up to me whether to merge or no.
These rules you must follow if you want your PR to be merged:
 * Write clean code (follow OOP shit please)
 * Follow the coding style of the project (see Google C++ Style Guide)
 * Do not change the file tree structure of the project as it might break lot's of things
